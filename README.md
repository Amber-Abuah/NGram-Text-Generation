The app uses three N-grams: a Bigram, Trigram and Fourgram to generate further text from a context provided by the user.
The predicted following words are generated by Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) models, trained on each N-gram.  

Below is an example of an autocomplete of the sentence _'I was in awe when I noticed'_ from each N-gram:

>**Bigram:** I was in awe when I noticed her friends in last...  
>**Trigram:** I was in awe when I noticed by the window. Emma then looked up; but as long as...   
>**Fourgram:** I was in awe when I noticed her father's house, he pleased them all.
